Task-4 Email Spam Deetection with machine learning
Spam or Ham EDA & SMS Classification" focuses on analyzing and classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). The kernel typically includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to visualize and understand the dataset, uncovering patterns and features that distinguish spam from ham messages. It likely employs various machine learning algorithms for classification, showcasing techniques like data preprocessing, vectorization of text data, and model evaluation metrics to assess performance.
